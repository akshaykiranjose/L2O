To run the code, these are the required libraries
```
* tensorflow == 2.9.0
* autograd
* matplotlib
* tqdm
```

Once the requisites are verified and the files are downloaded, run
```
python main.py -h
```
to get help with the required arguments for running.

An example of a complete run command would be
```
python main.py -s 123 -nF 100 -nI 150 -lr .03 -p True
```
wait till it gets run and find the plot.
