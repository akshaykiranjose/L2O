## Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent - TF2

Head over to the Wiki on L2O for a more comprehensive view on the paper and my implementation.

- [x] Quadratics
- [ ] MNIST

The content in the repo. varies ever so slightly from the paper and is a work under progress.

#### To be implemented:

- [ ] Coordinate-Wise optimizer
- [ ] GPU Run
